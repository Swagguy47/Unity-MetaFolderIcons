# Unity-MetaFolderIcons
 Customizable folder & hierarchy icon system for Unity.

Derives from:
https://github.com/SeaeeesSan/SimpleFolderIcon

With heavy modification to add more customization, editor windows, hierarchy categories, easier multi-word icons, non-case sensitive icons, guid based icon loading & icon baking.

Works by injecting custom data into the .meta file for each customized folder, then detecting & parsing that data when rendering icons.
